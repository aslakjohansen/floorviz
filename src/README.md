# FloorViz: a Floor Visualization Technology Demonstrator for Brick, HodDB and sMAP

## User Workflow

1. Enter an URI for a HodDB installation exposing a model containing the required annotations. Press enter. This will bring up the schematics of the building, load a list of supported modalities and start data collection.
2. Choose a modality. Doing so will update the view into the collected data.

# Required Annotations

# Future Work

- Support for aspects other than the spatial (floorplan). This includes the HVAC, district heating and lighting systems.
